# What is the Megablocks Framework?

The Megablocks Framework is the latest IAC and automation project from the APFM TechOps team. The Megablocks was started with the goal to simplify and standardize 80% of our deployments **_WITHOUT_** waiting on resources from the TechOps team. The megablocks Framework is comprised mostly of GitHub Actions and Terraform, very similar to what we've been doing with Bamboo and Terraform, but this will eventually replace Bamboo.

## What are the objectives of the Megablocks Framework? 

* Enable faster deployments to dev, qa, and production by reducing reliance on outside teams to provision infrastructure.
* Establish a library of supported tools, languages, technologies, and standards.
* Improve consistancy and speed of code promotion and deployments.
* Detect errors and deviations from standard before they make it to production.
* Improve cost control and administrative visibilty into resources

## What do I need to do to use this?

Again, the core idea behind The Megablocks Framework is to speed up development times, not make you learn another language. You only need to learn one technology, Github Actions (GHA). All you, as a developer, are required to do is supply a yml in the root of your code repository and configure the GHA's on your repo and you're off to the races!
