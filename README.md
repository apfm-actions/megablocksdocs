# MegaBlocks Docs: A Guide to Using the APFM TechOps Github Actions

Just a simple site on how to use the various tools and actions we're maintaining and developing in the apfm-actions repository. The site is a modified copy of the gatsby-theme-sky-lite-starter template and can be found here: https://github.com/vim-labs/gatsby-theme-sky-lite-starter

Documentation is presented in a series of blog posts and will be updated regularly.
